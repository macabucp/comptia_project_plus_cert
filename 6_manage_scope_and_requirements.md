# **Collecting Requirements and Defining Scope**

## **1. Introduction**

- **Purpose**: 
  - Understanding the process of collecting requirements and defining the scope is essential for successful project management. These foundational steps set the stage for the entire project by establishing what needs to be done and how it will be achieved.

## **2. Scope vs. Requirements**

### **2.1. Project Scope**
- **Definition**: 
  - The work that must be performed to deliver the final project result, whether it is a product, service, or other outcome.
- **Types**:
  - **Predictive Projects**: Scope is defined at the beginning of the project and documented in the project plan.
  - **Adaptive Projects**: Scope evolves over time, with iterative refinements throughout the project lifecycle.

### **2.2. Project Requirements**
- **Definition**: 
  - Conditions or capabilities necessary in the project's final deliverable to satisfy business needs and stakeholder requirements.
- **Sources**:
  - Requirements are directly obtained from stakeholders.
- **Relationship**:
  - Requirements are used to build the scope of the project, guiding the work that needs to be done.

## **3. Collecting Requirements**

### **3.1. Methods of Data Gathering**
- **Brainstorming**: 
  - Collecting ideas from a group of stakeholders in an open discussion format.
- **Interviews**: 
  - Conducting one-on-one or small group interviews to capture specific requirements.
- **Focus Groups**: 
  - Engaging a selected group of stakeholders to discuss and identify requirements.
- **Questionnaires and Surveys**: 
  - Distributing forms or online surveys to gather requirements from a larger audience efficiently.

### **3.2. Analyzing and Documenting Requirements**
- **Analysis**: 
  - Determine if requirements fit within the project's charter and objectives.
- **Documentation**:
  - Record the requirements, classify them (e.g., business, stakeholder, quality), and decide which ones will be included in the scope.
- **Decision-Making**:
  - The project manager, often with the project sponsor and team, will decide on the final set of requirements that will shape the project scope.

## **4. Defining the Scope**

### **4.1. Process Overview**
- **Engaging Experts**:
  - Consult subject matter experts (SMEs) and project team members, especially those with experience in similar projects.
- **Scope Statement**:
  - Develop a detailed scope statement that serves as an overarching document outlining the project's key objectives and deliverables.
- **High-Level Definition**:
  - The scope statement defines what the project aims to achieve, without going into the specific tasks or activities that will be required.

### **4.2. Scope and Requirements in Project Types**
- **Predictive Projects**:
  - Scope is fully defined at the start, guiding the entire project lifecycle.
- **Adaptive Projects**:
  - Scope is revisited and refined as the project progresses, allowing for flexibility and adaptation based on changing requirements.

## **5. Managing Stakeholder Expectations**

- **Communication**:
  - Regularly communicate with stakeholders about the requirements and scope, especially when changes or exclusions are made.
- **Documentation**:
  - Keep detailed records of all decisions regarding requirements, including the rationale for excluding or modifying specific requirements.

## **6. Conclusion**

- **Integration**:
  - The process of collecting requirements and defining the scope is crucial for setting clear project goals and expectations.
- **Importance**:
  - These steps lay the groundwork for the project's success by ensuring that all stakeholder needs are considered and appropriately addressed.

# **Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

## **1. Introduction**

- **Purpose**: 
  - The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a fundamental project management tool used to break down a projectâ€™s scope into manageable components. This serves as the foundation for estimating time, costs, and resources, making it essential for successful project execution.

## **2. Understanding the WBS**

### **2.1. Definition**
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**:
  - A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to accomplish project objectives and create deliverables.
  - **Deliverables** are broken down into smaller, more manageable components called **work packages**.
  - **Work Package**: The lowest level in a WBS that defines individual tasks or activities to be completed.

### **2.2. Importance of WBS**
- **Foundation**:
  - Sets the groundwork for planning, scheduling, budgeting, and resource allocation.
- **Tracking and Managing**:
  - Each work package is assigned a unique ID, which is used for tracking and managing the progress throughout the project.

## **3. Creating the WBS**

### **3.1. Steps to Create a WBS**
- **Step 1: Define Project Deliverables**:
  - Identify all the deliverables that the project aims to produce.
- **Step 2: Decompose Deliverables**:
  - Break down each deliverable into smaller, manageable work packages or activities.
- **Step 3: Assign Unique IDs**:
  - Assign a unique identifier to each work package for tracking and managing purposes.

### **3.2. Levels of WBS**
- **Top Level**:
  - Represents the final deliverable or the project itself.
- **Subsequent Levels**:
  - Decompose the project into smaller deliverables and work packages.
- **Lowest Level**:
  - Individual work packages or activities that are small enough to estimate time, cost, and resources accurately.

### **3.3. Working with Experts**
- **Collaboration**:
  - Project managers often collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs) and team members to decompose the WBS accurately.
- **Expertise**:
  - Utilize the expertise of the team and SMEs to ensure that all aspects of the project scope are captured and broken down into actionable tasks.

## **4. Sample WBS Example**

### **4.1. Example Overview**
- **Sample Project**: Charity Event Planning
- **Phases**: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Follow-up
- **Activities**:
  - Each phase includes various activities such as creating and sending invitations, booking a venue, etc.
  - Activities can be further decomposed if needed (e.g., creating and sending invitations could be separate tasks).

### **4.2. Key Observations**
- **Interdependencies**:
  - Some activities depend on the completion of others (e.g., estimating costs before booking a venue).
- **Risk Identification**:
  - Early identification of risks based on the WBS structure (e.g., cost estimation vs. actual booking costs).

## **5. Importance of WBS in Project Planning**

### **5.1. Basis for Estimating**
- **Schedule and Budget**:
  - The WBS is critical for determining the project's schedule and budget, as it breaks down the work into units that can be individually estimated.

### **5.2. Flexibility in Different Project Types**
- **Predictive Projects**:
  - The WBS is fully defined at the beginning, serving as a comprehensive roadmap for the entire project.
- **Adaptive Projects**:
  - The WBS may evolve over time, with placeholders for future activities that will be defined as the project progresses.

## **6. Conclusion**

- **Foundational Tool**:
  - The WBS is a crucial tool in project management, providing the structure needed to plan, execute, and monitor the project's progress.
- **Adaptability**:
  - While the WBS provides a solid foundation, it must be flexible enough to accommodate changes, especially in adaptive project environments.
