# **Upcoming Milestones and Activity Identification**

## **1. Introduction**

- **Purpose**: 
  - To understand how to identify activities and milestones when creating a project schedule.

## **2. Importance of Milestones and Activities**

- **Milestones**:
  - Major event completions or significant points in the project.
  - Serve as high-level markers for project progress.
  - Often used to communicate with stakeholders.

- **Activities**:
  - Individual tasks or actions needed to complete a milestone.
  - Activities are broken down into smaller work units to make them manageable.

## **3. Creating the Project Schedule**

### **3.1. Predictive Projects**

- **Approach**:
  - The project manager uses the completed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to identify milestones.
  - The schedule and activities are defined in detail at the beginning of the project.
  - The entire project scope and sequence of activities are established upfront.

### **3.2. Adaptive Projects (Agile)**

- **Approach**:
  - High-level milestones are identified, but detailed activities are broken down only for the current cycle or sprint.
  - The project manager works with the team to define activities and milestones iteratively.
  - Activities are refined and detailed as the project progresses through each cycle.

## **4. Identifying Milestones and Activities**

### **4.1. For Predictive Projects**

- **Milestones**:
  - High-level events such as the completion of an iteration, release, or significant project phase.
  - Example: Starting the first iteration or completing a key increment.

- **Activities**:
  - All tasks are identified based on the WBS.
  - Activities are detailed and sequenced in advance.

### **4.2. For Adaptive Projects (Agile)**

- **Milestones**:
  - May be defined for each sprint or iteration.
  - Example: Completing the initiating steps in the first sprint.

- **Activities**:
  - Focus on breaking down only the activities needed for the current sprint.
  - Activities are sequenced within the sprint to achieve the sprint goal.

## **5. Sprint Goal in Agile Projects**

- **Definition**:
  - A sprint goal is an overarching objective that the Scrum team plans to achieve during the sprint.
  - Example: Complete all initiating steps and obtain event approval in the first sprint.

- **Activity Identification**:
  - Activities are broken down into manageable work units that fit within the sprint timeframe.
  - Example: If the sprint duration is two weeks, ensure all activities can be completed within this period.

  - The smallest unit of work in an Agile framework.
  - Describes a feature or end goal from the user's perspective.
  - Occurs during a sprint, typically lasting one to two weeks.
  - Developed by team members and stored in the product backlog.
  - Example: "As a banking customer, I want to view my loan balances so that I can pay my monthly payment."

- **Tasks**:
  - Work items required to complete a user story.
  - Can be further divided into subtasks.
  - Generally completed within a day or a couple of days.
  - Example: Task could be "Design the loan balance interface."

## **3. Story Estimation**

- **Purpose**:
  - To estimate the amount of effort required to complete a user story.
  - Helps in sprint planning and resource allocation.

- **Estimation Process**:
  - Story points are assigned to user stories before they are moved into a sprint.
  - Estimations are maintained in the product backlog.
  - The estimation process considers the user's persona, needs, and the purpose behind the story.

- **Story Points**:
  - A unit of measure to estimate the effort required to implement a user story.
  - Not directly related to time but to the complexity and effort.
  - Example: A story that requires minimal effort may be assigned 1-2 points, while a more complex story may be assigned 8-13 points.

## **4. Example of Story Estimation in a Banking Application**

- **User Story**:
  - "As a banking customer, I want to view my loan balances so that I can pay my monthly payment or choose to pay a higher amount."

- **Importance of the Why**:
  - Understanding why the user wants a particular feature helps in aligning it with business needs.
  - The why behind this user story is to ensure the customer can manage their loan payments effectively.

## **5. Visual Representation**

- **Structure**:
  - **Themes** > **Epics** > **User Stories** > **Tasks** > **Subtasks**

# **Sequencing Activities in Project Management**

## **1. Introduction**

- **Purpose**: 
  - To understand the relationships and dependencies between project activities and how to sequence them effectively.

## **2. Understanding Dependencies**

- **Definition**:
  - Dependencies are the relationships between project activities that determine the order in which tasks need to be completed.

### **2.1. Types of Dependencies**

- **Mandatory Dependencies (Hard Logic)**:
  - Tasks that must occur in a specific order due to the nature of the work.
  - **Example**: Clearing land before laying the foundation for a building.

- **Discretionary Dependencies (Soft Logic)**:
  - Tasks that can be completed in any order but are sequenced based on best practices or team preferences.
  - **Example**: Electrical wiring and plumbing can be done simultaneously, but it's often preferred to start one before the other based on convenience.

- **External Dependencies**:
  - Dependencies on tasks or events outside the control of the project team.
  - **Example**: Waiting for paint to be delivered before starting painting.

- **Internal Dependencies**:
  - Dependencies within the project team's control.
  - **Example**: Painting cannot begin until drywall installation is completed.

### **2.2. Combining Dependencies**

- **Mandatory External**: 
  - **Example**: Waiting for rented equipment to arrive before starting construction.
- **Mandatory Internal**: 
  - **Example**: Completing drywall before starting electrical work.
- **Discretionary External**: 
  - **Example**: Waiting for an external approval before proceeding with internal activities.
- **Discretionary Internal**: 
  - **Example**: Deciding the sequence of tasks that could technically be done simultaneously.

## **3. Understanding Relationships**

- **Definition**:
  - Relationships, also known as successor and predecessor relationships, describe how the start or finish of one activity is related to another.

### **3.1. Types of Relationships**

- **Finish-to-Start (FS)**:
  - The most common relationship where a task must finish before the next one can start.
  - **Example**: Foundation must be finished before walls can be constructed.

- **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**:
  - The successor task cannot finish until the predecessor task finishes.
  - **Example**: Electrical work must finish before the drywall work finishes.

- **Start-to-Start (SS)**:
  - Both tasks start simultaneously or in coordination.
  - **Example**: Pouring concrete and leveling it must start at the same time.

- **Start-to-Finish (SF)**:
  - The successor task cannot finish until the predecessor task starts.
  - **Example**: The old pipeline cannot be decommissioned until the new pipeline is operational.

## **4. Applying Concepts with Examples**

### **4.1. Charity Event Example**

- **Mandatory Relationships**:
  - **Dependency**: Cannot estimate the cost (1.3) until the food and beverages are decided (1.2).
  - **Relationship**: Must choose a date and time (1.1) before booking a venue (2.3).

- **Discretionary Relationships**:
  - **Example**: Sending thank you notes (4.1) before sending a follow-up survey (4.2) to influence positive survey feedback.

### **4.2. Real-Life Project Examples**

- **Finish-to-Start**:
  - **Example**: Land clearing must be finished before foundation work can start.
  
- **Finish-to-Finish**:
  - **Example**: Electrical work cannot be finished until drywall work is finished.
  
- **Start-to-Start**:
  - **Example**: Concrete pouring and leveling must start together.
  
- **Start-to-Finish**:
  - **Example**: New pipeline construction must start before shutting down the old pipeline.

## **5. Conclusion**

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Understanding and identifying dependencies and relationships is crucial for effective project scheduling.
  - Proper sequencing ensures that tasks are completed in the correct order, avoiding delays and ensuring efficient project execution.

- **Cons**: 
  - More costly and time-consuming.
- **Application**: 
  - Varies based on industry and project type.

### **Three-Point Estimating**
- **Description**: 
  - Uses three different estimates: optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic.
- **Types**:
  - **Triangular**: 
    - All three estimates are given equal weighting.
    - Formula: (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3
  - **PERT or Beta**: 
    - Most Likely estimate is given more weighting.
    - Formula: (Optimistic + 4 * Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
- **Application**:
  - Best used when there is a high level of risk or uncertainty in the project.

### **Alternatives Analysis**
- **Description**: 
  - Involves comparing different options to determine the best approach based on resource cost and duration.
- **Examples**:
  - **Team Members**: 
    - Assign tasks based on individual efficiency to optimize project completion.
  - **Machinery**: 
    - Decide whether to rent or purchase equipment based on project needs and future requirements.

### **Reserve Analysis**
- **Description**: 
  - Used to determine contingency reserves (buffers) for identified risks and management reserves for unforeseen issues.
- **Types**:
  - **Contingency Reserves**: 
    - Included in the schedule and noted for handling known risks.
  - **Management Reserves**: 
    - Held for unforeseen work within the project scope and not listed in the project schedule.

## **3. Resource Loading**

- **Purpose**: 
  - Determining the availability and utilization of resources (human and physical) to complete identified activities.
  
### **Key Considerations for Human Resources**
1. **Allocation**: 
   - Determine if the resource is dedicated to the project or shared with other projects/departments.
   - **Negotiation**: 
     - May be required with functional or project managers for shared resources.
2. **Maximum Hours**:
   - Identify the maximum number of hours per day a resource is available for the project.
3. **Realistic Work Hours**:
   - Estimate the realistic number of hours a team member can work, accounting for interruptions and breaks.
   - **General Rule**:
     - Estimate 65-75% of the available time as productive work hours.

### **Physical Resources**
- **Easier to Estimate**:
  - Based on documented daily rates for machinery or equipment.
- **Considerations**:
  - **Downtime**: 
    - Account for scheduled maintenance or updates that affect availability.

  - Resource loading ensures that project managers efficiently allocate human and physical resources.
  - Understanding the trade-offs of each estimating technique helps in selecting the most appropriate one for the project context.
  - Resource management is crucial to maintaining project timelines and budgets.

# **Schedule Maintenance**

## **1. Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Understanding the processes involved in maintaining a project schedule, including contingency reserves, cadence, and critical path analysis.

## **2. Contingency Reserves**
- **Definition**: Extra time added to the schedule to handle identified risks.
- **Buffer Utilization**:
  - **Process**: The project manager decides to use part of the contingency reserve when necessary.
  - **No Change Request Needed**: Because the contingency reserve is part of the project schedule, no formal change request is required.
  - **Critical Path Impact**: 
    - If used on a task on the critical path, the overall project duration may increase.
    - If used on a non-critical path task, it won’t impact the overall project schedule unless it extends the task beyond the allowable time.
  - **Reporting**: Usage of contingency reserves should be tracked and reported to the project team, stakeholders, and sponsors.

## **3. Impacts on Cadence**
- **Cadence**: The sequence of project tasks that creates a working pattern or rhythm for the project team.
  - **Types of Cadence**:
    - **Daily Cadence**: Regular execution of tasks by individual developers.
    - **Iteration/Flow Cadence**: Deciding which items to take up next, emphasizing communication and interaction.
    - **Release Cadence**: Delivery schedule, can be after multiple iterations, after every iteration, or on-demand.
    - **Meeting Cadence**: Frequency of team meetings, such as daily stand-ups or weekly status meetings.
  - **Impact of Interruptions**: 
    - Interruptions can disrupt the established cadence, potentially leading to schedule issues.
    - High-functioning teams develop a rhythm that, when disrupted, can affect the schedule more than expected.

## **4. Critical Path Analysis**
- **Definition**: The process of identifying the critical path in a project, which is the sequence of tasks that determines the shortest possible project duration.
  - **Critical Path**: The longest path through the project schedule, determining the minimum time needed to complete the project.
  - **Monitoring**: Activities on the critical path need close monitoring; delays on these tasks will extend the project duration.
  - **Multiple Critical Paths**: Projects may have more than one critical path, increasing the risk and complexity of schedule management.

## **5. Forecasting**
- **Purpose**: Helps in reconciling what was planned vs. what has been achieved.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Planned Value (PV)**: Budgeted cost for work scheduled to be done at a given point.
  - **Actual Cost (AC)**: Money spent for the work accomplished.
  - **Earned Value (EV)**: The budgeted cost for the actual work completed by a given time.
  - **Schedule Variance (SV)**: 
    - Formula: SV = EV - PV.
    - Interpretation: Positive SV indicates ahead of schedule, negative SV indicates behind schedule.
  - **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**: 
    - Formula: SPI = EV / PV.
    - Interpretation: SPI > 1 indicates ahead of schedule, SPI < 1 indicates behind schedule.
  - **Cost Variance (CV)** and **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**: Additional metrics to track budget performance.

## **6. Publication and Sharing**
- **Key Consideration**: 
  - Be cautious in sharing detailed project schedules; too much detail may overwhelm stakeholders.
  - **Milestone Charts**: Commonly shared with stakeholders, focusing on high-level progress rather than individual tasks.
  - **Gantt Charts**: Another popular format, showing activities, durations, start and end dates, without detailing the assigned resources.

## **7. Sprint Planning**
- **Event in Scrum**: Defines what can be delivered in the upcoming sprint and how it will be achieved.
  - **Sprint Goal**: The objective the team plans to achieve.
  - **The What, How, and Who**:
    - **What**: The backlog items to be addressed in the sprint.
    - **How**: Planning the work needed to achieve the sprint goal.
    - **Who**: Assigning team members to specific activities.

## **8. Backlog Prioritization**
- **Backlog**: A list of work for the development team, derived from the project roadmap and requirements.
  - **Prioritization**: The product owner identifies the most important items to be addressed first.
  - **Balancing Work**: Teams may choose lower-priority items for a sprint to give the team a break or to quickly achieve a sense of progress.

## **9. Conclusion**
- **Importance**: Schedule maintenance is crucial for keeping the project on track and ensuring timely completion.
- **Focus Areas**: Regularly monitor the critical path, maintain cadence, utilize contingency reserves wisely, and keep stakeholders informed with appropriate schedule details.
