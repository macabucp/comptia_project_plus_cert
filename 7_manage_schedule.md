# **Revise Baseline vs. Rebaseline**

## **1. Introduction**

- **Purpose**:
  - Understanding the difference between revising a baseline and rebaselining is crucial for effective project management.

## **2. What is a Baseline?**

- **Definition**:
  - A baseline is a fixed reference point that represents the approved plan for the project, including scope, schedule, and cost. It serves as the foundation for measuring project performance.

### **2.1. Types of Baselines**
- **Scope Baseline**:
  - Represents the approved project scope and is documented at the beginning of the project.
  - For predictive projects, it includes the entire project scope.
  - For adaptive projects, it focuses on the scope for the current cycle.
  
- **Schedule Baseline**:
  - Represents the approved project timeline.
  - For predictive projects, it includes the entire schedule.
  - For adaptive projects, it is limited to the current cycle with an overall projected end date.

- **Cost Baseline**:
  - Represents the approved budget for the project.
  - For predictive projects, it includes the entire project budget.
  - For adaptive projects, it is built incrementally as the project progresses.

## **3. Revise Baseline**

- **Definition**:
  - Revising the baseline involves updating the current baseline due to approved changes that affect the project's scope, schedule, or cost.
  
- **When to Revise**:
  - When a change request is approved, and it alters the original project parameters.
  - Common changes include scope adjustments, quality improvements, team changes, or reordered deliverables.
  
- **Process**:
  - The original baseline is retained for historical reference.
  - The revised baseline includes the new changes, allowing the project to adapt while keeping a record of the original plan.

- **Key Concept**:
  - **"Change request = Revised baseline"**: Always associate change requests with the need to revise the baseline.

## **4. Rebaseline**

- **Definition**:
  - Rebaselining occurs when the project plan needs to be completely re-assessed and a new baseline is established, essentially replacing the original baseline.
  
- **When to Rebaseline**:
  - When the project undergoes significant changes that make the original baseline irrelevant or unrealistic.
  - Examples include major scope shifts, significant budget cuts or increases, or changes in project direction.

- **Process**:
  - The original baseline is replaced by a new baseline that reflects the updated project plan.
  - All previous performance data is compared against the new baseline for future tracking.

- **Key Concept**:
  - Rebaselining is more drastic than revising; it involves setting a completely new standard for project performance measurement.

## **5. Key Differences**

- **Revised Baseline**:
  - **Purpose**: Adjust the current plan while retaining the original for historical reference.
  - **Trigger**: Approved change requests that slightly modify the project plan.

- **Rebaseline**:
  - **Purpose**: Replace the original plan with a new one due to major project changes.
  - **Trigger**: Significant changes that render the original baseline irrelevant.

## **6. Conclusion**

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Understanding when to revise a baseline versus when to rebaseline is essential for maintaining accurate project tracking and performance measurement.
  - Revising a baseline keeps the project on track with adjustments, while rebaselining sets a new course for the project.
